# Personal Site made using React.js



### Project logs:
* Added header and about sections, font awesome icons in the about section are not working


### Next Steps:
* config react app to use scss instead of css
* implement project showcase concept on codepen 

### CSS Notes:
* Use em for font-size 
* definition of a float: a box that is shifted to the left or right on the current line. The most intersting characteristic of a float is that content may flow along its side(or be prohibited from doing so by the "clear" property). Content flows down the right side of a left-floated box and down the left side of a right-floated box.
